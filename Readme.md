Este.js is full-fledged development stack for building robust web apps, streamlined for the developer user experience. It contains well-documented, thoroughly tested JavaScript framework, written in statically-typed CoffeeScript. This allows you to write powerful and efficient code for browsers and mobile devices.

Tested on and compatible for OSX, Linux, and Windows.

### Quick Start Guide

  - Install Node.js (0.8+)
  - `git clone http://github.com/Steida/este.git`
  - `cd este`
  - `node run app`
  - Point your browser to `localhost:8000`
  - Build something beautiful

#### For Windows Users
  - Install Java, Python (Windows for some reason needs version < 3)
  - Set environment variables for Python and Java
  - http://docs.python.org/using/windows.html#excursus-setting-environment-variables

### More Information

Run `node run app -h` to see command line options.

Take a look at TodoMVC app in `assets/js/este/demos/` demos. It defines structure, feature-based namespacing, soy templates, custom events, and much more. We're actively working on a mobile version for ShopMVC on this stack, which should give greater clarity by means of example.
